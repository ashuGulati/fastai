one can upload images directly from google
split it into valid directly by giving percentage
can view your total train_ds and valid_ds
can plot the top_losses
remove the top losses by using the delete widget
??FileDeleter
open_image
train_loss shouldn't be higher than valid_loss
so, either train more or try higher learning rate
a correctly trained model will always have training loss lower than validation loss
metrics are genreally applied to validation dataset
unbalanced data works fine, try it
SGD- stochaistic gradient descent
PyTorch - tensor is an array;- rank/axes is the dimension
